# sql-retail-analytics-project

#This project is part of my Data Engineering learning journey.
#I am building a complete SQL-based analytics system for a simulated e-commerce company.
#The goal is to strengthen my SQL fundamentals, analytical thinking, data modeling, and real-world query writing.

#The project simulates data from a small online retail company.
#It includes customers, products, orders, payments, and line-items.

#This SQL project helps me practice:

#Database design

#Writing SQL queries from beginner level to advanced

#Real-world analytics used by companies

#Data quality checks & performance tuning
